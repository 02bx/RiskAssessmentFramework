### GSOC IDEA - Creation of Dashboard and integration of SAST tool to Auto-generate assessment scores!

The whole project is divided into 3 phases *(Testing and documentation is also done in each phase)*
1. Dashboard Creation 
2. Integration of SAST tool 
3. Auto-generation of score

###### *This file follows the phase 1 i.e., Dashboard Creation*

### PHASE-1 : Dashboard Creation 
#### Dashboard Prototype  
###### *for better UI and UX feature selection*
Below are the prototype images of the dashboard and its features. Currently, a simple dashboard layout, easy for any user to manage. Charts and graphs are used for data visualization and analysis.
The theme, presentation along with the placement of the items may change with the progress of the project. This is the first prototypic view of the dashboard for better understanding.
